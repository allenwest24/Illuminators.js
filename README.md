# Illuminators.js
Illuminators.js is a Draw.io/Diagrams.net custom plugin that allows you to clearly highlight different portions of a system diagram. You can assign each component of a system to different roles and paths, then you can search for these filters and toggle their illuminator on/off to help explain visually and clearly.
