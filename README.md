# Illuminators.js
Illuminators.js is a Draw.io/Diagrams.net custom plugin that allows you to create multiple filters that clearly highlight different portions of a system diagram. You can assign each component of a system to different roles and paths, then you can search for these filters and toggle their illuminator on/off to help explain visually and clearly.

- Set Illuminators via dialog box.
- Toggle illuminators on and off. (One at a time by design.)
- Stateful illumination. (Required to export with Illum activated)
